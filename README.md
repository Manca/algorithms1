# Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1
Stanford's Coursera course on algorithms. It can be taken here: https://class.coursera.org/algo-007/

This repo contains my solutions to the problems posted in the course. Feel free to give your solutions as well.
They are coded in C++ and C++11 is used whereever it seemed natural (auto iterator type deductions, maybe some lambads,
range-for loops and many others... will see how it goes tho)

## Problems
1) Count number of inversions in an array. Running time O(nlogn)

2) Compute the total number of comparisons used to sort the given input file by QuickSort

3) Karger's Min-Cut algorithm

4) Strongly Connected Components computation algorithm

5) Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm

6.1) 2-SUM Problem

6.2) Median Maintenance
